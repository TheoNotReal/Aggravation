# AGGRAVATION

## OBJECT

To move all four of a player's marbles from Base position to "home safe" on the board. You are not need to be AGGRAVATING, but it is recommended.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR SINGLE PLAYER MODE

To decide who goes first, each player rolls his dice once. The player who rolls the highest number is the first to select a color and place the four marbles in the "Base" position, as indicated in the figure. Each player chooses his color and places his four marbles in "Base" position as the game moves to the left. The first player rolls his die now that all of the marbles are in "Base" position. To move a marble from "Base" to "Start" (marked by a single hole of the player's color), either a one or a siz must be rolled. Players take turns rolling their die, moving marbles that have been begun exactly the same number of places or beginning a new marble. Also, if a six is rolled, that player gets an extra turn IF he can utilize the six that was just rolled. A player may not leap or land on a marble of his own color as the game progresses. When a player's marble falls on a spot held by another player's marble, he may AGGRAVE BY REPLACING THAT MARBLE WITH HIS OWN. The marble must be re-started by the AGGRAVATED player from his "base" position. Until they're "home safe," marbles are ALWAYS vulnerable to AGGRAVATION. The game is won by the first player to "safe home" all four marbles.

### USING THE OPTIONAL "SHORT-CUTS"

On the playing board, there are six "Short-Cut" corner places and one "Short-Cut" center-board position. When the number rolled puts a player's marble precisely on one of six corner "Short-Cut" locations, he may opt to move that marble around utilizing just the corner holes starting with his next turn, shortening the route to his "Safe-Home" objective. A player may advance whatever number of spaces as rolled, counting around the corner holes until he reaches the row leading to his "Safe-Home" location, utilizing this short-cut technique. As in normal play, he then proceeds down that row to his "Home" region. When a player rolls the precise number that would put him in the center hole if he chooses to utilize it, the center-board position is a "Super Short-Cut" that may be used from any point on the board. A player must roll a "one" to leave the center-board "Short-Cut" position, after which he may move to any of the six corner places on the board. This technique is a fantastic "Short-Cut" to a player's "Home" and a superb defensive move when one of the opponents is almost completed. WARNING: BEWARE! "Short-Cuts" are popular, and you may be AGGRAVATED there as well!

### Changes

You can only roll to land on another corner shortcut while leaping between them. This implies that if you wish to return to your home row, you must land precisely on the corner one turn and then go along your row the following round.

### Choose player

Increase the number of players to allow for additional spaces to put player names. Enter a name and a color for each player (red, blue, green, white, orange, or yellow). Each color has just one participant. A minimum of 2 and a maximum of 6 participants may be formed.

### Who is Going First?

The initial color is selected at random from the current player list. The order of the remaining players is likewise determined at random.

## Procedure for making a basic turn

Click on the die picture to roll it.
Click on the stone of your choice to move it. The stone is moveable with your current roll if it is highlighted. A notice will display if you are unable to move any marbles, and your turn will be finished.
Choose a spot to move the stone from the highlighted options. By clicking on a separate stone, you may pick which one you want to move.
A popup will appear, requesting confirmation of the transfer. If you choose yes, your marble will be moved to the location you specify, and the following player's turn will begin. If you select no, you will be sent to the previous stage.

## Winning

A player wins when they have all four marbles in their home base. The game will end once a message is shown
